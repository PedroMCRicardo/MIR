MIR Task: Beatbox Dataset Evaluation Using Automatic Drum Transcription

According to MIREX2018, drum transcription is defined as the task of detecting the positions in time and labeling the drum class of drum instrument onsets in polyphonic music. The article A Review of Automatic Drum Transcription offers an indebt explanation about automatic drum transcription as well as an extremely up to date state of the art.
The present task proposes to test and evaluate a beatbox dataset using an automatic drum transcription algorithm - ADTLib. To do so, a second dataset ENST-Drums (used initially to develop ADTLib) will be used as a term of comparison.
Further conclusions about the beatbox dataset and it's elements will be made.
